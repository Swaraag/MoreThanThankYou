After a few email exchanges, she resolved all my outstanding questions. I wanted to extend an MTTY to her and offered to help her build an FAQ page by collecting questions in advance from parent community. Counselors typically get similar questions from several families and it would be good to compile a page with FAQs. She said they usually build an FAQ page during course registration and she was happy to have my help to socialize the page.	Sammamish,WA			Act of Gratitude	2/12/2024

2/15/2024 20:39:01	Smaran	smaranmlp@gmail.com	This one was a while ago -- just wanted to share it.  Every time I would buy snacks or lunch at my school's cafeteria, I was always greeted with the joyful smile of the lunch lady that would scan my student ID. Every day, it didn't matter what she was going through, or how long she spent scanning those, because she greeted every single person with a smile. Every single time she finished scanning, she would thank us, even though she was the one doing us a favor.  I wanted to let her know how amazing she was, but a simple 'thank you' really just didn't mean anything. So I wrote a card. This card was not small. I truly put my heart into it, just as she had done for everyone else, making everyone's day a little brighter even if they didn't realize it. At the bottom, I wrote an acrostic poem with her name. So when I stood in the lunch line, and let her scan my card, I felt proud taking the sealed envelope that lay in my backpack, and giving it to her.  "This is for you." Her face lit up. From that day on, she smiles extra wide when she sees me, never forgetting to ask how my day is going. That is a connection I'll never forget. That is a person who I learned more about, and who I hope I helped, just a little bit as she had done for everyone else.  That is more than just a 'thank you'.

He was our pillar of support and helped us on many occasions since 2007, when we purchased and moved to our current home.  His son-in-law Dan, who lives nearby, had stroke many years ago and can’t drive and has other limitations. Mr. T used to take Dan to play pool occasionally.  Dan loves playing pool. With Mr. T gone, there is nobody to take Dan to play pool. So, to pay it forward for what Mr. T did for us, I take Dan to play pool occasionally and buy him his favorite drink - Diet Coke.  It gives me an opportunity to get out of the house, get to know Dan better and cherish memories of Mr. T.	Issaquah	Dan 		Pay It Forward	2/18/2024

2/19/2024 23:15:01	Nick C	nickchhabra@gmail.com	At work recently we were asked to share stories and give shout-outs to teammates to celebrate the Employee Appreciation day on March 1st.  I thought hard on who do I really appreciate. Many names crossed my mind, some deserving, and some not.  I decided instead to send an application for my team’s leadership team instead. You know why? Leadership team gets blamed for everything, for the reorgs, layoffs, projects going over budget, lack of funding for employee training, employee burnout, etc. I have had my fair share of criticism towards them. This email made me pause, made me think,  made me realize that it must be hard for the leadership team to make tough decisions, to keep everyone on the team happy, to take the brunt of the blame, and for never complaining (at-least not publicly).  I put my ego aside and submitted my appreciation for all the hard work our leadership team has been doing to support us, the team.  It gave me sense of relief,  to think positive, to get rid of cynicism and be appreciative. Thank you MTTY initiative for the opportunity to share my experiences and stories.

They are not related to me. They are related to a good friend of mine from College. They are my friend’s uncle and aunt (mama and mami ji).  When I was in college, one year I had no job, no money and I was looking for a place to stay until I found my footing.  This couple gave me the shelter and let me stay at their home for a few months.  I have never forgotten that act of kindness and I make sure to visit them, cheer them up and thank them for being my pillar of support when I needed it most.  Weird part of this is that my friend has not been touch with them because of some typical family conflict. My friend knows that I visit his uncle and auntie and he is ok with it.

2/22/2024 14:01:18	Nick Chhabra	nickchhabra@gmail.com	I was in India in October 2023 visiting family.  I wanted to meet a childhood friend of mine who lived about 250 Kms from Delhi. My sister hired me a round trip cab through a reliable source.  While sitting in the cab on my way to see my friend, the cab driver started to talk about his financial struggles, his crumbling home in the village that he has no money to fix, his inability to provide for his two school going kids, etc.  He knew I wasn’t a local and asked me where my home is.  He asked me to give him the financial assistance he badly needed.  His sob story continued on my way back to Delhi later that evening.  It was a bit depressing to hear about his struggles. I didn’t promise him anything that day but I told him, I will see what i can do.    I spoke about this situation with my friend I was visiting and then with my sister when I returned.  Both told me not to give the cab driver anything as he is an opportunist and I am being taken advantage of.  I returned to the US and spoke to my wife about this. Deep down, for some odd reason, I believed that the cab guy’s financial situation is indeed dire.  We decided to sponsor fixing his home.  We have sent him money twice so far and ready to send a third installment soon.  We thought that sending money in installment might be better instead of lump sum.    My wife recently asked if I can ask the cab driver to send the picture of his home renovations.  And, I said sometimes we need to do what we think is the right thing to do without judging or questioning.    We have no idea if the cab driver really fixed his home or not. He did message and called once to share that renovation is underway. We plan to send him rest of the money he needs and then wish him well, find comfort in knowing that we made a difference and acknowledge that we had many helping hands who uplifted us over the years. Paying it forward, one person at a time. 	New Delhi	Avinash		Pay It Forward	very recently				Yes				
2/22/2024 20:44:23	Eshwari somisetty	eshunaidu29@gmail.com	In 2018, during our summer vacation in India, my husband fell ill while we were boarding our flight back to the USA. His condition worsened during the flight. After enduring a long wait at immigration, my husband's fever worsened to the point where he couldn't stand. With me holding our 2-and-a-half-year-old and 7-year-old, we finally made it home. As his fever persisted, my husband had to go to the emergency room alone. I was unable to accompany him due to my inability to drive on the freeway, and I was also responsible for taking care of our children who had jet lag, had to take care of their food preparations.  This experience made me realize the importance of family support, which we lack in the USA compared to India. While people in the USA are busy and can only offer help on weekends, I had to reach out to some good friends without hesitation. I called my best friends Ramya and Chinnu, who generously offered to help despite being busy with their infant. They kindly looked after my children for a few hours and drove me to the hospital. Thanks to them, I was finally able to see my husband.  The doctors struggled to diagnose his fever until our family doctor in India suggested a dengue test. His platelet count dropped to 10,000, so platelet transfusions were immediately administered. Hospital visits with my young child were challenging, so I sought help from Sai and Smitha, colleagues from our office. They provided rides to the hospital and offered tremendous support during my lonely moments at the hospital.  Our community members also showed great kindness by sending lunch to my husband in the hospital. We later discovered that he contracted dengue in India, which was confirmed by test results received two weeks after his discharge.  Now, whenever Ramya, Chinnu, Sai, or Smitha go to india and come back to USA, I express my gratitude by preparing and sending them home-cooked Indian meals for two to three days. This gesture alleviates their burden of cooking after a long and exhausting 22-hour flight. I have been doing this consistently for the past three to four years as a token of my appreciation for their support during our difficult times. This makes me so so happy , people can help financially but in USA most of our friends are working so they are well off but I  felt  feeding people when they are really hungry(it doesnt need to be only to the poor people but people who are in real need of food and so very drained from that long journey that they cant cook)  I also remember their kindness during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 when I helped two community friends who had recently given birth. Since their parents couldn't travel to help them, I cooked special meals for the new moms and delivered them daily for a month, despite my busy work schedule. Seeing their happiness while enjoying my food brought me immense joy, and I felt fulfilled knowing I could assist them during a challenging time(may be not that challenging but you should all agree cooking is a such big deal here specially when there is no help). I share this not to boast but to express my gratitude for the support I received. I am always ready to help those who helped me and whoever in need, and I am deeply indebted to them and always pray to god to  give me that power of giving to others in any way for ever."

After a few weeks he had to go to India suddenly for family reasons. In India he tried to finish most of his work but he could not finish all of it. While he was gone we got a huge graded performance in orchestra. He missed this so he had to make up for it. Fortunately we both chose the same song so I invited him over to my house to teach him for a few weeks. He really seemed to appreciated it and nailed the performance. I was glad to have helped.

2/24/2024 10:28:59	Veni Raghavan	venivijay27@gmail.com	It was July , 2018, we were in Paris for vacation for a week’s time . We were at full ecstasy and holiday mood. Enjoying thoroughly in the Paris streets. It was a fine Monday morning around 9’0 clock, we took the train to reach the chocolate factory Musée du Chocolat. It’s located  like half mile walk from the train station. On the way , we went to a grocery store to pick up some potato bread , fruit trays , and some drinks for breakfast. We wanted to be first in the queue to get the tickets. Because  we were in a rush , I did not notice anything on the pavement. I was so disparate to get the tickets ,just dragged my daughter’s hand with me. My husband was holding the  younger one  behind me. When I reached there, there were hardly few people at the counter. I booked the tickets and was waiting for my husband to come.It took  about 15 minutes for him to reach. . He came to me and asked did you get the tickets. I said yes. How many he asked. I said 3 tickets  that I got , because under 5 it’s free. He took one of  the tickets and got the refund in cash and  said  to me “you take the kids and enjoy” . I’ll wait at the corridor. I was surprised , “what happened to him” . But we did not have time to talk,  just walked inside the museum and came back after about an hour after leaving my daughter at  the place where she can  make her own chocolate . Then I asked him, can we have the breakfast? He said “on way back to train station, we can have.”. What, we already bought the breakfast,  I started searching for the bag. My younger one replied calmly. Don’t worry amma, we gave away the food to the street girl. She is a poor girl amma. I was so impressed by his words. Then my husband told me, there is a mom and two kids in that pavement. One is about 4 years old and the other one is 2 years. That girl looked pathetic and  looking for someone to feed her. I saw the hunger in her eyes and immediately gave away the food  that we bought in that store. I did not have enough euros, that’s the reason I returned my ticket and encased the refund and gave 25 euros to her. “That’s totally fine”, he said. At once, I felt ashamed myself that day. I realized that  how much  self centered I was and ignored that girl on the pavement when I was passing by. Till today, I can’t forgive myself and forget that incident. I thanked my husband for his kind gesture . It was more satisfying than the chocolate factory tour. More than other spots in Paris, this place is piercing through my heart  till today. Small , small kind  gestures make our life more meaningful and inspire our kids to be  compassionate and helpful to the society.

Our neighbor Mr. Perry is retired and lives with his wife. I see him often walking in the neighborhood. He is always approachable and willing to talk but I am either busy with some activity or preoccupied to spend the few minutes to chat with him. Last week, I decided to make a conscious effort to talk to him. I asked him how things were going, how he maintains his pristine garden and he asked me how my new non-Tesla electric car was. I also re-introduced my kids to him. He chatted with them about their schools. He talked to my son about basketball as he always sees him shooting hoops outside.  I felt like we made him feel comfortable to reach out to us if he ever needs any help or even if he just wants to chat.

3/1/2024 12:28:30	Manya		This isn't exactly an MTTY, but I wanted to share the story as maybe in a couple of months, it will be something I can express my gratitude for.  I'm a part of our school's track team, and since I'm a freshman, I'm relatively new to the sport and how it works. All the sophomores and upperclassmen have a good idea of what's going on, and that used to (and sometimes still does) intimidate me - I didn't want to seem stupid and mess up on my form or have a lack of knowledge on something.  Yesterday, when everyone was leaving track practice to go home and the varsity members of the team started weightlifting, I thought I should go home and made up some excuses because I had never done "real" weightlifting before. But I decided to stay, and even if it was really embarrassing, ask one of the varsity members or coaches to show me how to start lifting as a beginner.  I didn't expect this, but I received really thoughtful and supportive words of encouragement as the coaches told me they didn't even start lifting until their senior year of high school. They showed me the proper technique of how to do weighted squats and start lifting weights on the bar, helping me for at least 30 minutes. They didn't even complete their workout, but instead opted to help me get better and learn the technique. I didn't even feel embarrassed, and once I started to get the basics down, they even cheered me on.  I didn't think I would like it, but I think I will start liking weightlifting in a couple of months when I become better at it, and I really appreciate the kind and supportive community we live in where we help each other learn and grow.

If your birthday is in July then you would celebrate it in January.This way everyone gets their special day in school.Instead of just saying just thank you, we all wanted to do something special.

3/3/2024 12:37:25	Nick Chhabra		Recently, one weeknight I slept very late, later than usual, to finish some work.  Next day, by the end of day I was feeling very tired.  As I was leaving work that day I decided to take local roads instead of my regular route via I-90, as it was dark and rainy, and I just wanted to take it bit easy and highway driving during rush hour is more stressful.  However, my plan backfired. While driving back, one stretch was through a dark curvy downhill road at the cougar mountain.  A split second lapse on my part had me hit the curb and right passenger side tire went flat.  I was angry, frustrated and in disbelief (at myself for hitting the curve).  I called the roadside assistance and they told me that they will be there in 2.5 hours.  After several minutes I decided to cancel the service and pull up my sleeves to change the tire with the spare tire myself.  As I started to figure this out, a young gentleman - Tom - showed up. He lived in the nearby apartments and saw my car, with hazard lights on, from his window and decided to come help.  He offered to help and I couldn’t say no. He went back to his home and brought his car, turned the headlights on, and parked right behind my car so that I could see better in that dark and replace the tire. As I was on a slope, Tom also walked 20 yards and picked up a huge rock to put under the rear wheel so that the car doesn’t roll when I jacked it up. Something I didn’t think through.  After I was done replacing the tire, I thanked Tom and asked if I could buy him coffee sometime as my token of appreciation.  We exchanged numbers and went our way. We tried meeting a few times but timings didn’t align.  I decided to send him a $50 Amazon Gift Card instead as I had his number, as meeting in person wasn’t working out. He sent me a nice note upon receiving the card.  A stranger helping another stranger with no expectations is what makes us humans. I will always remember his kindness.

He was a very nice person as he encouraged all of us, to treat his classroom and music as a place to forget about all of our problems and really have fun. Though he was new, he made a lot of efforts to make sure that he got to know all of us, and made assignments that were very fun, and educational at the same time. Overall, he was an incredible teacher and with his support we even got to compete and won an incredible score. At the end of the year concert, when he left, we decided to surprise him by giving him a bouquet and a special large stuffed animal of a character that he really liked. We also all spoke about him, and gave a card signed with our names. This really made his day and ours. We were able to show our appreciation by going way beyond just the words "thank you."

While I was participating in my event, she went out with some of her other friends as they invited her, and said she would meet back with me after I was done. I finished my event and realized that it was raining and windy outside and my friend was still at the mall. She said she would come back anyway to meet with me, so we could go for lunch together, which was extremely nice of her. After she came back I thanked her, gave her a jacket, and bought her a scone, as the place that we were going to did not accept cash. She appreciated this act, and it made me feel good to repay my friend that was very kind with something more than kindness.

3/6/2024 11:08:07	Akshath Avyukth 		3 weeks back we went to Maui for a vacation. Every day when we go out and come back to the hotel tired we used to feel how thankful we are to the house keeping team who keeps the room clean and make it feel like home again.   On the third day of the trip kids were really appreciating their efforts so I asked them to write a thank you note and leave it on the kitchen countertop.  Next day  the person who cleaned our room was waiting to see who wrote the note. She met me on the way to elevator and said this is the best thing I saw in my 10 years of work here of what your kids wrote to me. She was extremely thankful and said it feels good and motivated to see someone appreciating her work and she will save the thank you note forever.  I told the boys later the whole thing and they kept writing thank you notes almost everyday as different crew cleans each day😊   Kids learned how important it is to express the thank you. Many times we don’t know or see the person who’s helping us in behind, this time kids said we can still thank them with this simple messages even though we don’t meet them in person.

I told my friend to head on to her next class as it was an important one she could not miss. Mine was less important so I can come a bit late. I went over to her and asked her name. She told me what it was and we talked for a bit. I asked her what her schedule was and she showed me it was down the opposite way. I walked her there to her class and wished her well. This action made my day go a lot better and made me a new friend. She is a great person and we are pretty close in a span of a couple of days. Doing a MTTY act allowed me to make a new great friend.

I was on a call during the pickup window and completely forgot about it. She forgot to take her watch that day and couldn't call me. A few minutes after the school dismissal, I suddenly remembered that I had to pick her. I rushed to get her. She was patiently waiting at the pickup spot for about 15 minutes. I apologized to my daughter and she was very understanding. I thanked her for being so understanding but wanted to do more for her.  I know she's been eyeing on my double hooped earrings for a while and I wouldn't let her borrow them as they were my favorite earrings too. So that day I gave the earrings to my daughter to keep, not just borrow. She was overjoyed. I was so glad that I did something to make her happy.

3/13/2024 17:44:20	Saritha		This story was from a couple of years ago. When I was working in an office, some of my co-workers and I used to eat lunch in the cafeteria everyday. There was another co-worker of mine (let’s call her Mrs.B) that would be alone for lunch mostly. One day Mrs.B asked if she could join us in the cafeteria and I happily invited her to our table. When we all about to eat, I realized that Mrs.B didn’t bring any lunch with her. I brought her a bowl and served some of the food from my lunch box for her. My other coworkers also shared their food with her. Mrs.B was overjoyed and was very grateful that we were all so kind to her. It was her first time eating spicy Indian food but she loved the food and said it felt here brain cells were opening up.  A few days later, we came know that Mrs.B’s financial situation was dire and she couldn’t even afford to bring lunch. She was in her sixties and had a family to support too. From then on, my co-workers and I started packing extra food for her. We made sure she had food to eat everyday. Sometimes she would take the food home with her. This is an experience I can never forget.	seattle	Co-worker		act of kindness	A long time ago	sarithalatha@gmail.com			No

She is thoughtful and empathetic, and always takes a moment to check in on me. I've wanted to showcase the gratefulness I have for her friendship and be there for her when something tough happens, and I got my opportunity yesterday.  Today was our first track meet, so everyone was still trying to figure out how the events and overall procedure worked. My friend ran the very last event, and while I was cheering, I noticed that she had fallen over (after her race) and was clutching her calf - she had either torn or hurt something really bad. I quickly got my water bottle and gave her some water, called someone over to help, and just stayed by her side (she could barely move), just like she had done so for me on so many occasions. She was very grateful for me being there and I was glad I could help a little bit.	Sammamish	Friend		Pay It Forward	Very recently	manyada@gmail.com			Yes

I showed my friend what I was  trying to make and a few days later he surprised me with the laser cut glass. I was really happy. A few weeks later we had to do some coding for the robot we had built. My friend had gotten sick and missed the first few days while the teacher was explaining how to code it. When he came back he realized he had no idea how to code it.

For track practice today, we were doing a distance run, so my friends and I decided to head down to the KCLS library and park nearby, where we saw many people walking. 2 women who passed us motivated us to run up the steep hills, which we considered jogging. Appreciating their motivation, we smiled and continued running. For the rest of the run, whenever I saw someone passing by, I smiled and said a simple "hello", even if people reacted differently. Some people said hi back, some people smiled, some just nodded, but it was nice interacting with people. Someone even asked us how we were doing and we had a small conversation, while we chatted at the crosswalk with some dog owners about pets.

3/21/2024 21:40:14	Manya		It may seem overrated for some of you, but we don't value our parents enough. Not only do they love us unconditionally, but they put aside their comfort and conveniences to make us happy. Sometimes we forget thay, just like us, they want to relax and wind down as well, and I would like to thank all parents and responsible people in our community today with this small story.   I'm on trash duty Thursday nights, as the truck comes Friday mornings (I never hesitate to complain about it). As usual, I gathered the trash and was put in in the big bins. My dad usually puts the bins outside after I put the trash in the bins, but I thought I would be "responsible" and do that too today. I opened the garage to put the bins outside and I saw a frog. It was a baby frog, but a frog nonetheless. I hate bugs, slimy creatures, and anything like that, so obviously, I did what any normal person would do - close the garage and run inside the house, screaming. My dad had just come home from work and changed into his home clothes, but he still went outside in the cold to go and drag the bins outside and make sure the frig wasn't anywhere near our garage (it's under our car outside right now).  My mom also does not like bugs, but she got over her fear (for the most part) by putting the spiders in the kitchen or bathroom outside whenever I saw them and ran 10 miles away from it.  Our parents do so much for us and conquer their own "fears", as well as sacrifice things, big and small. I wanted to take a day-to-day example as to highlight that, but that does not mean I want the frog to be here every day. Thank you.

3/22/2024 20:19:08	Vaibhav Kolli		A small act of kindness goes a long way, one of the two quotes I live by, and have been since ages ago when I had just read about it in a short story by Maya Angelou. Although it was only relevant to the class as a short story for an essay, I was inspired to develop it in my everyday life, for example holding the door open, giving a pencil to another classmate if they needed it, and asking every teacher about their day, everyday, since that day. I knew that one day, this act would spread to another person and another, just like an echo in a cave. Though the echo gets quieter as time flies, it continues to ring for each act of kindness.

3/23/2024 14:15:04	Vaibhav Kolli		This was a story from 2 years ago, when I was in 8th grade, around Thanksgiving, I was thinking about who I was thankful for, and the background music introduction and rondo capriccioso reminded me of my fourth grade teacher, Mrs. Vanhorne, who has given be so many gifts; the arts of the violin, the arts of friendships that last, the arts of the tips and tricks  in math and technology, all which have molded me into the person I am now. Although the material education she had taught me is much basic compared to the math I do now, the computer tricks and the violin have stuck to me till this day. I decided on that very thanksgiving to email her a thank you note , and added a poem about how much she had helped me.

My teacher usually doesn’t give retakes or the ability to do test corrections but she was feeling extra nice that day and decided the class will have a retake. My group mates decided to write a thank you letter in order to say MTTY to our teacher. I helped in this process.

To say more than thank you I decided to first help him out on his essay and then thank him with a gift for being a great helpful friend.

The owners were having trouble trying to get the dog to follow their orders so I decided to help them out. After a few minutes the dog finally calmed down and the kids were grateful for the help. They said they wanted to thank me in another way so they pulled out a candybar that they were reserving for later and gave it to me. I was happy to see that More thank thank you spread to others even though they didn’t know what it was. 	Bothell	Me		Act of Gratitude	Very recently	justdoittej@gmail.com			Yes
